The notebooks contain cells that have the ensemble models. I have included both the base ensemble and the improved ensemble model in each.

There are two notebooks for the Rossmann dataset, the one with the suffix (2) is the improved model. Both have cells with output codes as the outputs generated are high in number and may not be visible at once.

Output codes are also present in Walmart Sales dataset for the same reason.

Please note that while the base Energy demand model is quite instant in predictions, the improved energy demand and both Walmart models being decently computationally demanding and the Rossmann models may take a while to completely run.
